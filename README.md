# Simple DBMS Project

## Project Overview

This project explores the design and implementation of key components and functionalities commonly found in a Database Management System (DBMS). The focus is on understanding, assessing, and analyzing the behavior and performance of these components.

## Milestone 1: Core Table Operations

The following functionalities are implemented in this milestone:

1. **Create Table:**  
   - Define and initialize new tables in the DBMS.
2. **Insert into Table:**  
   - Add new records to existing tables.
3. **Select from Table:**  
   - Retrieve all data from a table.
   - Select data based on specified column values (conditional selection).
   - Use pointers for direct record access.
4. **Operation Trace Retrieval:**  
   - Retrieve a full or partial log of operations performed on a table.

These functionalities are implemented across the following architectural levels:

- **DBMS Level**
- **Table Level**
- **Page Level**

## Milestone 2: Indexing and Data Recovery

The second milestone extends the DBMS with advanced features, focusing on index behavior and data recovery:

1. **Bitmap Index Creation:**  
   - Build bitmap indexes to optimize query performance.
2. **Bitmap Index Insertion:**  
   - Efficiently insert records while maintaining the bitmap index.
3. **Index-Based Selection:**  
   - Use indexes for efficient data retrieval.
4. **Data Recovery:**  
   - Restore and recover data to ensure integrity and reliability.

## Learning Objectives

- Dive deeper into the inner workings of a DBMS.
- Analyze and assess the performance and behavior of different DBMS components.
- Gain hands-on experience with table management, indexing, and recovery strategies.

## Additional Notes

- This project is intended for educational use, simulating core DBMS functionalities in a simplified environment.
- The code and structure are designed for experimentation and analysis rather than production use.
